Ruby Object Mapper is an open-source persistence and mapping toolkit for Ruby built for speed and simplicity.

https://rom-rb.org/5.0/learn/

Ruby Object Mapper (ROM) is a fast ruby persistence library with the goal of providing powerful object mapping capabilities without limiting the full power of the underlying datastore.

More specifically, ROM exists to:

Isolate the application from persistence details
Provide minimum infrastructure for mapping and persistence
Provide shared abstractions for lower-level components
Provide simple use of power features offered by the datastore
